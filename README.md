# Data_Mining_on_Anti_Churn_Dataset

The goal of the project is to extract information and create value to support decisions.
Let's introduce what data mining is: set of techniques and methodologies aimed at extracting useful information from large amounts of data (e.g., databases, data warehouses, etc.), through automated or semi-automated methods (e.g., machine learning) and the scientific, business, industrial, or operational use of the same.

The problem was studied in the context of binary classification and addressed through techniques of feature selection, formal concept analysis, cross validation, undersampling
and oversampling, in order to solve problems related to the dimensionality of the data and classes unbalanced. Models such as the Random Forest, Logistic Regression, the Multi-Layer Perceptron and the Gaussian Naive Bayes were implemented; performance was evaluated in terms of.
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure and AUC. Finally, the quantile method was also applied as a further evaluation of the best performing model.
